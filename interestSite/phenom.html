			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt Lewin's Field Theory states that the way in which an object is perceived depends on the total context or arrangement of its surroundings. His theory gave way to experimenal social psychology as it defined behavior as a function of not only the person but also the current psychological environment. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called this area of person and environment the "Life Space", the totality of facts that determine behavior of one at a specific moment. This space only takes into account that which is contemporary and disregards past and future. All that matters is the present.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;George Kelly's Personal Construct Theory aimed to see the ways a person aligns events and his/her surroundings on his/her own dimensions. According to Kelly, different people may construe the same event diffferently and every event can be construed in alternative ways. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He elaborates on this thought by emphasizing that just how a scientiest studies people, these participants also construe behavior by interpreting an judging themselves and surroundings. Therefore, in order to understand a participant in an experiment, a researcher must understnand his/her own constructs and theories.</p>
