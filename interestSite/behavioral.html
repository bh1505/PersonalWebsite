			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan Pavlov (above) helped us better understand how we learn by founding: Classical Conditioning. It is a type of learning in which an organism comes to associate two different stimuli. With this, Pavlov is said to have laid the foundation for behaviorism as his studies were an objective sceince that studied solely behavior and no mental processes. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his famous and controversial Little Albert study, Pavlov helped prove that specific fears can be conditioned (learned). This occurs when sommething that naturally and automatically triggers fear is associated with a previously neutral stimulus. In the case of Little Albert, the presence of a rat followed by a loud starling noise soon resulted in Albert crying at the mere sight of the rat.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;B.F. Skinner also studied behavior and claimed that a person "is" what the person "does". Skinner developed the learning theory of Operant (Instrumental) Conditioning, which viewed behavior as modified by its consequences. In other words, the outcome of any response determines how likely a similar response will be used in the future. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinner believed that an operant (response) followed by a positive consequence (reinforcer) is more likely to be performed once again than an operant followed by a negative consequence (punsiher). </p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With this knowledge on learning, pscyhologists have been able to change emotional reactions of patients to certain stimulus. Conditioned aversion is when a positively valued stimulus becomes neutralized by counterconditioning if presented with extremel unpleasant stimuli. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the use of this method would be the treatment cocaine dependency. Patients were instructed to snort a fake cocaine while being injected with nauseating drugs. After, the patients were told to think of cocaine and pair its usage with negativte consequences while nauseous. At 6 months post treatment, a majority of the addicts had maintained abstinence.</p>
