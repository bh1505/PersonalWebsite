			<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;In personality psychology, “personality” refers to the person’s unique patterns of coping with and transforming the psychological environment. As a result, a goal of personality psychology is to discover and describe the individual differences of people that are psychologically meaningful and stable. Identifying these observed differences is an important goal for one trying to grasp another's personality because it allows one to describe people and attempt to predict their future behavior. But to fully understand an individual's differences, one must recognize the presence of an underlying organization or structure. As Gordon Allport defines it, personality psychology is ". . . the dynamic organization within the
individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his characteristic behavior
and thought’’. <br> <br>
				 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that being said, this website hopes to inform readers a bit on the subject of personality psychology. More specifically, it will explore a few of the levels of analysis at which personality is studied: the Behavioral-Conditioning, Phenomenological-Humanistic, and Psychodynamic-Motivational levels. In this website, each level will be briefly introduced and a few important theories found within each level will be discussed. The reason why I have chosen this topic for my interest site is because I am purusing a major in psychology and have found the subfield of personality to be quite fascinating. Thank you.
