				&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictured above is the famous Sigmund freud, or as others call him, the "father of psychology". In his perspective (psychodynamic), Freud defined personality as a result of unconscious psychological conflicts and how effectively they are resolved. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conflicts that
			Freud mentions originate from childhood experiences when instinctive urges and social norms clash. Although his views were controversial, he undoubtedly got the ball rolling for the psychodynamic level and some of his theories helped inspire other psychologists to contine researching the unconscious.

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychoanalysis is a form of psychotherapy that was founded by Freud. It aims at relieving neurotic conflicts and uncover 
			patients' unconscious, specifically painful memories that have been repressed and are unable to be recovered consciously by the patient.
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach the unconscious, therapists focus on the interpretation of dreams and use a method called free association in which the patient is encouraged to say absolutely anything that comes to mind.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl Jung (pictured above) founded Analytical Psychology. In his own approach, he agreed with Freud in that the unconscious does exert a powerful influence on personality, but he went on to add the concept of an inherited foundation of personality called the "collective unconscious." Along with a personal unconscious, the human mind uses the collective unconscious to reflect on unconscious images and patterns that reflect human history. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung also theorized a lot on the "self", stating that it continuosly strives for oneness and unity. Part of that eventual oneness comes from the integration of one's "shadow aspect" with the conscious psyche. In the case of men, they need to unite with their anima (passive, feminine shadow) and for women, they need to embrace their animus (assertive, masculine shadow).</p>
